# Disrupting Interference: 96th's Signal Mastery

## Project Overview

This project was undertaken by the 96th Cyberspace Test Group of the U.S. Air Force to develop a prototype system for detecting and addressing spurious radio signals. The main goal is to enhance the precision of identifying unauthorized signals originating from remote-control devices during field tests. By leveraging software-defined receivers, the project aims to improve signal detection capabilities in a cost-effective and scalable manner.

## Challenge

During field tests, unauthorized signals from various sources such as cell phones, GPS devices, radios, and drones interfere with the testing environment. These spurious signals can disrupt the sensitivity of tests and affect the reliability of results. The challenge is to accurately pinpoint these sources, eliminate them, and improve the overall testing environment without incurring high costs.

## Approach

The approach involves the following steps:
- **Signal Detection:** Deploy software-defined receivers strategically to detect spurious signals across various frequencies, including radio, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.
- **Source Identification:** Identify the sources of interference from devices such as drones, radios, and other electronic devices.
- **Elimination of Interference:** Pinpoint and shut off unauthorized devices causing interference to enhance the fidelity of tests.
- **Cost-Effective Implementation:** Focus on developing low-cost solutions compared to the high-cost alternatives typically used in military contracting.

## Implementation

The prototype system includes the following components:
1. **Software-Defined Receivers:** These receivers are used to scan the environment for unauthorized signals. They are remotely operable and can be expanded as needed.
2. **Signal Analysis Software:** The software analyzes detected signals to identify sources of interference and log their locations.
3. **Automated Interference Mitigation:** When unauthorized signals are detected, the system attempts to neutralize the interference by remotely shutting off the offending devices.

## Impact

By solving this problem, the project aims to:
- Save man-hours in data processing.
- Increase the security and reliability of testing environments.
- Improve the accuracy of test results by eliminating external interferences.
